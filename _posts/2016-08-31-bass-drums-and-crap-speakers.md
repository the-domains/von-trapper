Bass drums and crap speakers...

When you tend to listen to your own tracks on Studio Monitors with a ton of bass extension, no matter how accurate in the time and frequency domain, you tend to forget how important it is to listen to your music on the equipment your fans are likely to be using. This has all sorts of implications, not least of which is small speakers - and very often single speakers. Here's a few quick tips that you may find useful:-

1) Boosting bass frequencies will very rarely help sort out problems at the bottom end - small speakers just won't pump out more bass the louder you make it. Think about the bass they can hear, above 120Hz, and its harmonics, and leave the lower bass domain to the folks with decent sound systems to enjoy. Never forget, you can rarely leave the bass full-on in every track you combine to make a mash-up - generally, you 'choose' which of the tracks you're mashing will have the dominant bass and leave that in, and cut the bass in the other track(s) using a high pass filter.

2) Bass drums have a number of different components to their sound. The big bassy thump and boom is rarely heard through small speakers as it's usually somewhere between 25Hz and 80Hz. What you can hear are the upper harmonics and the click, traditionally of the beater hitting the drum head, but in electronic styles, usually a high frequency burst of noise that sounds like the click you get when you turn some hi-fis on. The click is your friend. If the track you choose to provide the bass drum from is light on click and heavy on boom, you can either add a click over the top, or sample the bass drum and 'amplify' its own click.

I use the excellent plug-in Big Kick for this - you can either select a bass drum sound with a strong click, and then use the built in high pass filter to take everything out of the bass drum except the click itself, or sample a bass drum note from the track you're using, load it into Big Kick and apply the same filtering technique. Once this is done, you can just build a MIDI track of bass drum beats that copies the main track (usually a quick process, though you need to be careful to keep an eye on the groove) and use it to trigger the Big Kick filtered click.

You don't have to use Big Kick of course - Load your bass drum sample in Ableton Live's basic sampler or drum rack and strap a high pass filter across it to achieve the same thing.
