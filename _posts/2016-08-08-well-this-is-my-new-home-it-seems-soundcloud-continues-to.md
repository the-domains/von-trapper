Well, this is my new home it seems. SoundCloud continues to wage accidental war on its loyal community of creators with takedown warnings and automated blocks on mash-ups. You can't even post privately, let alone publicly, with material it considers infringing.

While I don't make any judgment on the legality, it doesn't seem a wise decision when SoundCloud appears to be trying to be a poor man's Spotify with the opportunity for artists to upload unreleased music. In fact I'm not sure what SoundCloud wants to be at all.

So I shall put my mash-ups here for my friends to play if they want. A private oasis of musical mulching.
